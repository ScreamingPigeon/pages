These are some of the things I've worked on:
- *"Exploring Recurrent Neural Networks in Tai-Chi Practitioners"*, Society for Neuroscience 2024 (in-progress)
- *"Exploring Recurrent Neural Networks in Tai-Chi Practitioners"*, Society for PsychoPhysiological Research Conference 2024 (in-progress)
- *"Exploring Recurrent Neural Networks in Tai-Chi Practitioners"*, Brain Sciences Journal MDPI 2024 (in-progress)
- *"Adaptive Graph Thresholding"*, Coordinated Science Laboratory Student Conference 2024 ([poster](../research/CSLSC_24_poster.pdf)), ([abstract](../research/CSLC_Abstract.pdf))


And then there are some personal projects that haven't made it out of the figurative garage yet. Some of these are rejected submissions and I'm contemplating attaching feedback:
-  *Evaluating ML models and feature analysis techniques for Physical Activity Recognition in IMU devices*, ([In-Progress](../research/MS_2024_Abstract.pdf))
- *"GSP Techniques to evaluate network dynamics"*, Independent Study, ([Initial Report](../research/396_Final_Project_Report.pdf))
- *"Stressor Identification using EKG Derived Features and ML"*, IEEE BHI Conference 2023 Submission, ([Paper](../research/BHI2023.pdf))
